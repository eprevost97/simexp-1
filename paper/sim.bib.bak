	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the USA, about 30 200 well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas were diagnosed in 2007, but the prevalence of thyroid nodules is much higher (about 5\% of the adult population). Unfortunately, the preoperative characterisation of follicular thyroid nodules is still a challenge, and many benign lesions, which remain indeterminate after fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology are referred to surgery. About 85\% of these thyroid nodules are classified as benign at final histology. We aimed to assess the diagnostic effect of galectin-3 expression analysis in distinguishing preoperatively benign from malignant follicular thyroid nodules when FNA findings were indeterminate. METHODS: 544 patients were enrolled between June 1, 2003, and Aug 30, 2006. We used a purified monoclonal antibody to galectin-3, a biotin-free immunocytohistochemical assay, and a morphological and phenotypic analysis of FNA-derived cell-block preparations. Galectin-3-expression analysis was applied preoperatively on 465 follicular thyroid proliferations that were candidates for surgery, and its diagnostic accuracy was compared with the final histology. FINDINGS: 31 patients were excluded because they had small galectin-3-negative thyroid nodules; we did not have data for 47 patients; and one patient with an oncocytic nodule was excluded. 331 (71\%) of the assessable 465 preoperative thyroid FNA samples did not express galectin-3. 280 (85\%) of these galectin-3-negative lesions were classified as benign at final histology. Galectin-3 expression was detected, instead, in 134 of 465 (29\%) thyroid proliferations, 101 (75\%) of which were confirmed as malignant. The overall sensitivity of the galectin-3 test was 78\% (95\% CI 74-82) and specificity was 93\% (90-95). Estimated positive predictive value was 82\% (79-86) and negative predictive value was 91\% (88-93). 381 (88\%) of 432 patients with follicular thyroid nodules who were referred for thyroidectomy were correctly classified preoperatively by use of the galectin-3 test. However, 29 (22\%) of 130 cancers were missed by the galectin-3 method. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that if the option of surgery was based theoretically on galectin-3 expression alone, only 134 thyroid operations would have been done in 465 patients; therefore a large proportion (71\%) of unnecessary thyroid surgical procedures could be avoided, although a number of galectin-3-negative cancers could be potentially missed. The galectin-3 test proposed here does not replace conventional FNA cytology, but represents a complementary diagnostic method for those follicular nodules that remain indeterminate.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments tested a signal-detection theory (SDT) model of visual search (e.g., as described in J. Palmer, C. T. Ames, \& D. T. Lindsey, 1993). In Experiment 1, participants searched for a 0 degrees line among distractors at (a) 30 degrees; (b) 1/3 at 30 degrees, 2/3 at 50 degrees; (c) 1/3 at 30 degrees, 50 degrees, and 70 degrees; and (d) 1/3 at 30 degrees, 2/3 at 70 degrees. The SDT model predicts improved performance in the more heterogeneous conditions, as some distractors are more discriminable from the target. In contrast, in Experiment 1 human performance degraded in the more heterogeneous conditions (c and d). In Experiment 2, sparser displays improved the performance of the SDT model. In Experiment 3, search for theta degrees among homogeneous theta + 20 degrees distractors was compared with search for theta degrees among theta+/-20 degrees distractors. Performance in the latter condition was often worse, relative to performance in the homogeneous condition, than predicted by the SDT model; however, this depended greatly on the identity of the target.},

	Abstract = {The web is not perfect: while text is easily searched and organized, pictures (the vast majority of the bits that one can find online) are not. In order to see how one could improve the web and make pictures first-class citizens of the web, I explore the idea of Visipedia, a visual interface for Wikipedia that is able to answer visual queries and enables experts to contribute and organize visual knowledge. Five distinct groups of humans would interact through Visipedia: users, experts, editors, visual workers, and machine vision scientists. The latter would gradually build automata able to interpret images. I explore some of the technical challenges involved in making Visipedia happen. I argue that Visipedia will likely grow organically, combining state-of-the-art machine vision with human labor.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral observations as a matrix of probabilistic changes of postures and acts are multiple measurements that could introduce variability to statistical analysis. We propose the multimetric statistical algorithm that supplements the linear analysis of variance by pair correlation, factor and discriminant function analyses. Although these methods were utilized mostly in behavioral studies, the combined use in frame of one behavioral test was not done before. In present study statistical techniques were applied to analyze social behavior in Turku aggressive (TA) and Turku non-aggressive (TNA) mouse lines, bidirectional selected for offensive aggression towards an unknown male. Each statistical technique amplified new details of mouse behavioral profiles that give possibility to describe TA and TNA subjects in terms of Cloninger's model of personality. Also, it was identified that TA mice displayed fighting-biting aggression while TNA mice demonstrated immobile defensive strategy. Hypothetical discriminant formula was found for each mouse behavioral genotype that might be used to identify behavioral profile and line affiliation of unknown subjects.},

	Abstract = {An experiment was designed to automatically assess the relative level of social interaction during encounters involving trios of inbred mice consisting of two familiar cage mate males plus an unfamiliar third male. The automation of the spatial positioning was obtained by using a video-tracking program. In addition social behaviours were manually scored. To evaluate the influence of basic motor properties on the evaluation of the level of social interaction, we analysed two strains (C57BL/6J and 129S2/Sv) that are frequently employed in transgenic research, and show very different levels of motor activity. Correlations between manual and automated parameters showed that spatial parameters correctly fitted the level of social interaction between mice. In both strains C57BL/6J and 129S2/Sv, a proximity parameter (duration of bouts during which two individuals were close to each other) defined the social approach and correctly assessed the discrimination of social novelty.},

	Abstract = {Many experiments have investigated visual search for simple stimuli like colored bars or alphanumeric characters. When eye movements are not a limiting factor, these tasks tend to produce roughly linear functions relating reaction time (RT) to the number of items in the display (set size). The slopes of the RTxset size functions for different searches fall on a continuum from highly efficient (slopes near zero) to inefficient (slopes>25-30ms/item). Many theories of search can produce the correct pattern of mean RTs. Producing the correct RT distributions is more difficult. In order to guide future modeling, we have collected a very large data set (about 112,000 trials) on three tasks: an efficient color feature search, an inefficient search for a 2 among 5s, and an intermediate colorxorientation conjunction search. The RT distributions have interesting properties. For example, target absent distributions overlap target present more than would be expected if the decision to end search were based on a simple elapsed time threshold. Other qualitative properties of the RT distributions falsify some classes of model. For example, normalized RT distributions do not change shape as set size changes as a standard self-terminating model predicts that they should.},

	Abstract = {Security surveillance systems often produce poor-quality video, and this may be problematic in gathering forensic evidence. We examined the ability of subjects to identify target people captured by a commercially available video security device. In Experiment I, subjects personally familiar with the targets performed very well at identifying them, but subjects unfamiliar with the targets performed very poorly. Police officers with experience in forensic identification performed as poorly as other subjects unfamiliar with the targets. In Experiment 2, we asked how familiar subjects can perform so well. Using the same video device, we edited clips to obscure the head, body, or gait of the targets. Obscuring body or gait produced a small decrement in recognition performance. Obscuring the targets' heads had a dramatic effect on subjects' ability to recognize the targets. These results imply that subjects recognized the targets' faces, even in these poor-quality images.},

	Abstract = {Diffusions are useful for image processing and computer vision because they provide a convenient way of smoothing noisy data, analyzing images at multiple scales, and enhancing discontinuities. A number of diffusions of image brightness have been defined and studied so far; they may be applied to scalar and vector-valued quantities that are naturally associated with intervals of either the real line, or other flat manifolds. Some quantities of interest in computer vision, and other areas of engineering that deal with images, are defined on curved manifolds;typical examples are orientation and hue that are defined on the circle. Generalizing brightness diffusions to orientation is not straightforward, especially in the case where a discrete implementation is sought. An example of what may go wrong is presented.A method is proposed to define diffusions of orientation-like quantities. First a definition in the continuum is discussed, then a discrete orientation diffusion is proposed. The behavior of such diffusions is explored both analytically and experimentally. It is shown how such orientation diffusions contain a nonlinearity that is reminiscent of edge-process and anisotropic diffusion. A number of open questions are proposed at the end.},

Selenium was determined by proton induced x-ray emission. In Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma the mean serum levels of selenium were not different from those of the control group. On the contrary lowered mean serum selenium concentrations were observed in the group with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (5.2 +/- 0.7 microgram/100 ml) as compared to normal individuals (7.9 +/- 0.3 microgram/100 ml). The difference is highly significant (P less than 0.005). A second selenium test was made in 11 out of the 38 patients within 8 weeks from the beginning of radiotherapy or chemotherapy; unchanged levels were found.},

	Abstract = {The red blood cell (RBC) glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and routine haematological parameters were measured in 38 healthy north Italian full-term pregnant women and in their newborn infants. In 31 pairs the serum selenium concentration was also measured. Data were compared with those of 20 normal adult controls (10 males and 10 females). Newborn infants exhibited significantly lower RBC GSH-Px activity and serum selenium concentrations than adult controls. Pregnant women had serum selenium values intermediate between those of adult female controls and their newborn infants. In both the pregnant women and newborns the RBC GSH-Px activity correlated with the level of selenium in serum which suggests that the neonatal RBC GSH-Px deficiency may be partially due to insufficient availability of selenium during pregancy. Factors other than selenium concentration, e.g. hormonal and genetic, might also affect the RBC GSH-Px activity as suggested by sex differences and mother/child concordances in enzyme activity found in our cases.},

	Abstract = {Cases showing erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) defects have been previously described. Our experiments demonstrate that a number of non genetic factors may influence the GSH-Px activity in human erythrocytes. Selenium administration in vivo was followed in four subjects by elevation in erythrocyte GSH-Px activity ranging from 30\% to 1400\%. Selenium operates mainly in the bone marrow erythroblasts by facilitating the synthesis of active GSH-Px molecules; experiments in vivo demonstrate that, in the youngest erythrocytes, selenium can raise the enzyme activity, but by a different mechanism. The reticulocyte GSH-Px activity appears to depend on selenium availability and may vary over a wide range. In some normal and iron deficient subjects the GSH-Px activity in the youngest erythrocyte fraction was equal or lower than that previously found in whole erythrocytes of patients affected by haemolytic anaemia. During erythrocyte life, GSH-Px activity may either diminish  or increase, and these variations are inversely related to the initial GSH-Px activity  in youngest cells. In vitro experiments with the addition of acetyl-phynyl-hydrazine strongly suggest that elevation of GSH-Px activity may be due to allosteric enzyme activation by activated oxygen.},

	Abstract = {The red cell glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of 9 normal subjects is compared with that of 15 cases of iron deficiency anaemia and with 13 cases of heterozygous beta-thalassemia with the same degree of anaemia and hypochromia. 2 cases of sideroblastic anaemia with high serum iron levels were also examined. Enzymatic activity was found to be significantly decreased in iron deficiency anaemia (about 55\% of normal range), while it was not affected in heterozygous beta thalassaemia and it was increased in the 2 cases of sideroblastic anaemia. Moreover, GSH-Px activity exhibited a significant correlation with serum iron levels in all the patients studied. The observed modifications in GSH-Px activity are not correlated with erythrocyte ageing because reticulocyte-poor fractions exhibited GSH-Px activity which was not significantly reduced in respect of the reticulocyte-rich ones. These data seem to suggest that iron has a crucial connection with erythrocyte GSH-Px and that the enzyme deficiency may be of some importance in explaining the decreased red cell survival observed in severe iron-deficiency anaemias.},

	Abstract = {Behaviour often depends on the ability to make categorical judgements about sensory information acquired over time. Such judgements require a comparison of the evidence favouring the alternatives, but how the brain forms these comparisons is unknown. Here we show that in a visual discrimination task, the accumulating balance of sensory evidence favouring one interpretation over another is evident in the neural circuits that generate the behavioural response. We trained monkeys to make a direction judgement about dynamic random-dot motions and to indicate their judgement with an eye movement to a visual target. We interrupted motion viewing with electrical microstimulation of the frontal eye field and analysed the resulting, evoked eye movements for evidence of ongoing activity associated with the oculomotor response. Evoked eye movements deviated in the direction of the monkey's judgement. The magnitude of the deviation depended on motion strength and viewing time. The oculomotor signals responsible for these deviations reflected the accumulated motion information that informed the monkey's choices on the discrimination task. Thus, for this task, decision formation and motor preparation appear to share a common level of neural organization.},

	Abstract = {Decision-making behavior has been studied extensively, but the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for this remarkable cognitive ability are just beginning to be understood. Here we propose neural computations that can account for the formation of categorical decisions about sensory stimuli by accumulating information over time into a single quantity: the logarithm of the likelihood ratio favoring one alternative over another. We also review electrophysio-logical studies that have identified brain structures that may be involved in computing this sort of decision variable. The ideas presented constitute a framework for understanding how and where perceptual decisions are formed in the brain.},

In both, a weight of evidence is computed and accumulated to support or oppose the alternative interpretations. A decision is reached when the evidence reaches a threshold value. In the codebreaking scheme, the threshold determined the speed and accuracy of the decision process. Here we propose that in the brain, the threshold may be controlled by neural circuits that calculate the rate of reward.},

They begin by analyzing 6 models of TAFC decision making and show that all but one can be reduced to the drift diffusion model, implementing the statistically optimal algorithm (most accurate for a given speed or fastest for a given accuracy). They prove further that there is always an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy that maximizes various reward functions, including reward rate (percentage of correct responses per unit time), as well as several other objective functions, including ones weighted for accuracy. They use these findings to address empirical data and make novel predictions about performance under optimality.},

	Abstract = {We propose a computational model for the task-specific guidance of visual attention in real-world scenes. Our model emphasizes four aspects that are important in biological vision: determining task-relevance of an entity, biasing attention for the low-level visual features of desired targets, recognizing these targets using the same low-level features, and incrementally building a visual map of task-relevance at every scene location. Given a task definition in the form of keywords, the model first determines and stores the task-relevant entities in working memory, using prior knowledge stored in long-term memory. It attempts to detect the most relevant entity by biasing its visual attention system with the entity's learned low-level features. It attends to the most salient location in the scene, and attempts to recognize the attended object through hierarchical matching against object representations stored in long-term memory. It updates its working memory with the task-relevance of the recognized entity and updates a topographic task-relevance map with the location and relevance of the recognized entity. The model is tested on three types of tasks: single-target detection in 343 natural and synthetic images, where biasing for the target accelerates target detection over twofold on average; sequential multiple-target detection in 28 natural images, where biasing, recognition, working memory and long term memory contribute to rapidly finding all targets; and learning a map of likely locations of cars from a video clip filmed while driving on a highway. The model's performance on search for single features and feature conjunctions is consistent with existing psychophysical data. These results of our biologically-motivated architecture suggest that the model may provide a reasonable approximation to many brain processes involved in complex task-driven visual behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Although much is known about the sources and modulatory effects of top-down attentional signals, the information capacity of these signals is less known. Here, we investigate the granularity of top-down attentional signals. Previous theories in psychophysics have provided conflicting evidence on whether top-down guidance is coarse grained (i.e., one gain control term per feature dimension) or fine grained (i.e., multiple gain control terms per dimension). We resolve the conflict by designing new experiments that disentangle top-down from bottom-up contributions, thereby avoiding confounds existing in previous studies. The results of our eye-tracking experiments show that subjects can selectively saccade to items belonging to the relevant feature interval compared with irrelevant intervals within a dimension. This suggests that top-down signals can specify not only the relevant feature dimension but also the relevant feature interval within a dimension. We conclude that top-down signals are fine grained and can specify multiple gain control terms per dimension.},

In this issue of Neuron, Navalpakkam and Itti take a computational approach to show that this strategy is actually very inefficient when the target is surrounded by distractors with similar features. Instead, the optimal strategy is to boost the activity of neurons that best discriminate between target and distractors, while essentially ignoring the neurons that respond best to the target.},

Previous research suggests that goal-driven attention enhances the gain of neurons representing the target's visual features. Here, we present mathematical and behavioral evidence that this strategy is suboptimal and that humans do not deploy it. We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy.},

	Abstract = {How do reward outcomes affect early visual performance? Previous studies found a suboptimal influence, but they ignored the non-linearity in how subjects perceived the reward outcomes. In contrast, we find that when the non-linearity is accounted for, humans behave optimally and maximize expected reward. Our subjects were asked to detect the presence of a familiar target object in a cluttered scene. They were rewarded according to their performance. We systematically varied the target frequency and the reward/penalty policy for detecting/missing the targets. We find that 1) decreasing the target frequency will decrease the detection rates, in accordance with the literature. 2) Contrary to previous studies, increasing the target detection rewards will compensate for target rarity and restore detection performance. 3) A quantitative model based on reward maximization accurately predicts human detection behavior in all target frequency and reward conditions; thus, reward schemes can be designed to obtain desired detection rates for rare targets. 4) Subjects quickly learn the optimal decision strategy; we propose a neurally plausible model that exhibits the same properties. Potential applications include designing reward schemes to improve detection of life-critical, rare targets (e.g., cancers in medical images).},

	Abstract = {The ability to choose rapidly among multiple targets embedded in a complex perceptual environment is key to survival. Targets may differ in their reward value as well as in their low-level perceptual properties (e.g., visual saliency). Previous studies investigated separately the impact of either value or saliency on choice; thus, it is not known how the brain combines these two variables during decision making. We addressed this question with three experiments in which human subjects attempted to maximize their monetary earnings by rapidly choosing items from a brief display. Each display contained several worthless items (distractors) as well as two targets, whose value and saliency were varied systematically. We compared the behavioral data with the predictions of three computational models assuming that (i) subjects seek the most valuable item in the display, (ii) subjects seek the most easily detectable item, and (iii) subjects behave as an ideal Bayesian observer who combines both factors to maximize the expected reward within each trial. Regardless of the type of motor response used to express the choices, we find that decisions are influenced by both value and feature-contrast in a way that is consistent with the ideal Bayesian observer, even when the targets' feature-contrast is varied unpredictably between trials. This suggests that individuals are able to harvest rewards optimally and dynamically under time pressure while seeking multiple targets embedded in perceptual clutter.},

	Abstract = {A brightness discrimination experiment was performed to examine how subjects decide whether a patch of pixels is "bright" or "dark," and stimulus duration, brightness, and speed versus accuracy instructions were manipulated. The diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) was fit to the data, and it accounted for all the dependent variables: mean correct and error response times, the shapes of response time distributions for correct and error responses, and accuracy values. Speed-accuracy manipulations affected only boundary separation (response criteria settings) in the model. Drift rate (the rate of accumulation of evidence) in the diffusion model, which represents stimulus quality, increased as a function of stimulus duration and stimulus brightness but asymptoted as stimulus duration increased from 100 to 150 msec. To address the argument that the diffusion model can fit any pattern of data, simulated patterns of plausible data are presented that the model cannot fit.},

Sets of simulated data were generated with known parameter values, and from fits of the model, we found that the maximum likelihood method was better than the chi-square and weighted least squares methods by criteria of bias in the parameters relative to the parameter values used to generate the data and standard deviations in the parameter estimates. The standard deviations in the parameter values can be used as measures of the variability in parameter estimates from fits to experimental data. We introduced contaminant reaction times and variability into the other components of processing besides the decision process and found that the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods failed, sometimes dramatically. But the weighted least squares method was robust to these two factors. We then present results from modifications of the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods, in which these factors are explicitly modeled, and show that the parameter values of the diffusion model are recovered well. We argue that explicit modeling is an important method for addressing contaminants and variability in nondecision processes and that it can be applied in any theoretical approach to modeling reaction time.},

Participants classified stimuli that varied on a unidimensional axis into 2 categories. The stimuli did not consistently belong to a category; instead, they were probabilistically assigned. By manipulating these assignment probabilities, it was possible to produce stimuli for which exemplar- and rule-based explanations made qualitatively different predictions. F. G. Ashby and J. T. Townsend's (1986) rule-based general recognition theory provided a better account of the data than R. M. Nosofsky's (1986) exemplar-based generalized context model in conditions in which the to-be-classified stimuli were relatively confusable. However, generalized context model provided a better account when the stimuli were relatively few and distinct. These findings are consistent with multiple process accounts of categorization and demonstrate that stimulus confusion is a determining factor as 10 which process mediates categorization.},

Each of the models was augmented with assumptions of variability across trials in the rate of accumulation of evidence from stimuli, the values of response criteria, and the value of base RT across trials. Although there was substantial model mimicry, empirical conditions were identified under which the models make discriminably different predictions. The best accounts of the data were provided by the Wiener diffusion model, the OU model with small-to-moderate decay, and the accumulator model with long-tailed (exponential) distributions of criteria, although the last was unable to produce error RTs shorter than correct RTs.

	Abstract = {Researchers in psychology are paying increasing attention to temporal correlations in performance on cognitive tasks. Recently, Thornton and Gilden (2005) introduced a spectral method for analyzing psychological time series; in particular, this method is tailored to distinguish transient serial correlations from the persistent correlations characterized by 1/f noise. Thornton and Gilden applied their method to word-naming data to support the claimed ubiquity of 1/f noise in psychological time series. We argue that a previously presented method for distinguishing transient and persistent correlations (e.g., Wagenmakers, Farrell, and Ratcliff, 2004) compares favorably with the new method presented by Thornton and Gilden. We apply Thornton and Gilden's method to time series from a range of cognitive tasks and show that 1/f noise is not a ubiquitous property of psychological time series. Finally, we assess the theoretical developments in this area and argue that the development of well-specified models of the principles or mechanisms of human cognition giving rise to 1/f noise is long overdue.},

In the response signal procedure, a stimulus is presented and then, at one of a number of experimenter-determined times, a signal to respond is presented. The models were fit to the data from the two procedures simultaneously under the assumption that responses in the response signal procedure were based on a mixture of decision processes that had already terminated at response boundaries before the signal and decision processes that had not yet terminated. In the latter case, decisions were based on partial information in one variant of each model or on guessing in a second variant. Both variants of the diffusion model fit the data well and both fit better than either variant of the LCA model, although the differences in numerical goodness-of-fit measures were not large enough to allow decisive selection between the models.},

	Abstract = {In this article, the first explicit, theory-based comparison of 2-choice and go/no-go variants of 3 experimental tasks is presented. Prior research has questioned whether the underlying core-information processing is different for the 2 variants of a task or whether they differ mostly in response demands. The authors examined 4 different diffusion models for the go/no-go variant of each task along with a standard diffusion model for the 2-choice variant (R. Ratcliff, 1978). The 2-choice and the go/no-go models were fit to data from 4 lexical decision experiments, 1 numerosity discrimination experiment, and 1 recognition memory experiment, each with 2-choice and go/no-go variants. The models that assumed an implicit decision criterion for no-go responses produced better fits than models that did not. The best model was one in which only response criteria and the nondecisional components of processing changed between the 2 variants, supporting the view that the core information on which decisions are based is not different between them.},

	Abstract = {The diffusion decision model allows detailed explanations of behavior in two-choice discrimination tasks. In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data-accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions-into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

@article{ratcliff2008b,
	Abstract = {In the response signal paradigm, a test stimulus is presented, and then at one of a number of experimenter-determined times, a signal to respond is presented. Response signal, standard response time (RT), and accuracy data were collected from 19 college-age and 19 60- to 75-year-old participants in a numerosity discrimination task. The data were fit with 2 versions of the diffusion model. Response signal data were modeled by assuming a mixture of processes, those that have terminated before the signal and those that have not terminated; in the latter case, decisions are based on either partial information or guessing. The effects of aging on performance in the regular RT task were explained the same way in the models, with a 70- to 100-ms increase in the nondecision component of processing, more conservative decision criteria, and more variability across trials in drift and the nondecision component of processing, but little difference in drift rate (evidence). In the response signal task, the primary reason for a slower rise in the response signal functions for older participants was variability in the nondecision component of processing. Overall, the results were consistent with earlier fits of the diffusion model to the standard RT task for college-age participants and to the data from aging studies using this task in the standard RT procedure.},

	Abstract = {Several sequential-sampling models using racing diffusion processes for multiple-alternative decisions were evaluated, using data from two perceptual discrimination experiments. The structures of the models differed on a number of dimensions, including whether there was lateral inhibition between accumulators, whether there was decay in evidence, whether evidence could be negative, and whether there was variability in starting points. Data were collected from a letter discrimination task in which stimulus difficulty and probability of the response alternatives were varied along with number of response alternatives. Model-fitting results ruled out a large number of model classes in favor of a smaller number of specific models, most of which showed a moderate to high degree of mimicking. The best-fitting models had zero to moderate values of decay, had no inhibition, and assumed that the addition of alternatives affected the subprocesses contributing to the nondecisional time, the degree of caution, or the quality of evidence extracted from stimuli.},

@article{warrenRushton09,
	Abstract = {We have recently suggested that the brain uses its sensitivity to optic flow in order to parse retinal motion into components arising due to self and object movement (e.g. Rushton, S. K., \& Warren, P. A(2005). Moving observers, 3D relative motion and the detection of object movement. Current Biology, 15, R542-R543). Here, we explore whether stereo disparity is necessary for flow parsing or whether other sources of depth information, which could theoretically constrain flow-field interpretation, are sufficient. Stationary observers viewed large field of view stimuli containing textured cubes, moving in a manner that was consistent with a complex observer movement through a stationary scene. Observers made speeded responses to report the perceived direction of movement of a probe object presented at different depths in the scene. Across conditions we varied the presence or absence of different binocular and monocular cues to depth order. In line with previous studies, results consistent with flow parsing (in terms of both perceived direction and response time) were found in the condition in which motion parallax and stereoscopic disparity were present. Observers were poorer at judging object movement when depth order was specified by parallax alone. However, as more monocular depth cues were added to the stimulus the results approached those found when the scene contained stereoscopic cues. We conclude that both monocular and binocular static depth information contribute to flow parsing. These findings are discussed in the context of potential architectures for a model of the flow parsing mechanism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Poggio and Reichardt (Kybernetik, 13:223-227, 1973) showed that if the average response of a visual system to a moving stimulus is directionally selective, then this sensitivity must be mediated by a nonlinear operation. In particular, it has been proposed that at the behavioral level, motion-sensitive biological systems are implemented by quadratic nonlinearities (Hassenstein and Reichardt: Z. Naturforsch., 11b:513-524, 1956; van Santen and Sperling: J. Opt. Soc. Am. [A] 1:451-473, 1984; Adelson and Bergen: J. Opt. Soc. Am. [A], 2:284-299, 1985). This paper analyzes theoretically two nonlinear neural mechanisms that possibly underlie retinal direction selectivity and explores the conditions under which they behave as a quadratic nonlinearity. The first mechanism is shunting inhibition (Torre and Poggio: Proc. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], 202:409-416, 1978), and the second consists of the linear combination of the outputs of a depolarizing and a hyperpolarizing synapse, followed by a threshold operation. It was found that although sometimes possible, it is in practice hard to approximate the Shunting Inhibition and the Threshold models for direction selectivity by quadratic systems. For instance, the level of the threshold on the Threshold model must be close to the steady-state level of the cell's combined synaptic input. Furthermore, for both the Shunting and the Threshold models, the approximation by a quadratic system is only possible for a small range of low contrast stimuli and for situations where the rectifications due to the ON-OFF mechanisms, and to the ganglion cells' action potentials, can be linearized. The main question that this paper leaves open is, how do we account for the apparent quadratic properties of motion perception given that the same properties seem so fragile at the single cell level? Finally, as a result of this study, some system analysis experiments were proposed that can distinguish between different instances of the models.},

	Abstract = {In an age of global combat against terrorism, the recognition and identification of people on document images is of increasing significance. Experiments and calculations have shown that the camera-to-subject distance - not the focal length of the lens - can have a significant effect on facial proportions. Modern passport pictures should be able to function as a reference image for automatic and manual picture comparisons. This requires a defined subject distance. It is completely unclear which subject distance, in the taking of passport photographs, is ideal for the recognition of the actual person. We show here that the camera-to-subject distance that is perceived as ideal is dependent on the face being photographed, even if the distance of 2m was most frequently preferred. So far the problem of the ideal camera-to-subject distance for faces has only been approached through technical calculations. We have, for the first time, answered this question experimentally with a double-blind experiment. Even if there is apparently no ideal camera-to-subject distance valid for every face, 2m can be proposed as ideal for the taking of passport pictures. The first step would actually be the determination of a camera-to-subject distance for the taking of passport pictures within the standards. From an anthropological point of view it would be interesting to find out which facial features allow the preference of a shorter camera-to-subject distance and which allow the preference of a longer camera-to-subject distance.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Clinically, it is difficult to differentiate the early stage of malignant melanoma and certain benign skin lesions due to similarity in appearance. Our research uses image analysis of clinical skin images and relative color-based pattern recognition techniques to enhance the images and improve differentiation of these lesions. METHODS: First, the relative color images were created from digitized photographic images. Then, they were segmented into objects and morphologically filtered. Next, the relative color features were extracted from the objects to form two different feature spaces; a lesion feature space and an object feature space. The two feature spaces serve as two data models to be analyzed to determine the best features. Finally, we used a statistical analysis model of relative color features, which better classifies the various types of skin lesions. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The best features found for differentiation of melanoma and benign skin lesions from this study are area, mean in the red and blue bands, standard deviation in the red and green bands, skewness in the green band, and entropy in the red band. With the relative color feature algorithm developed, the best results were obtained with a multi-layer perceptron neural network model. This showed an overall classification success of 79\%, with 70\% of the benign lesions successfully classified, and 86\% of malignant melanoma successfully classified.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a computer-based system for the automated diagnosis of melanoma in the hands of nonexpert physicians. We performed a prospective comparison between nonexperts using computer assistance and experts without assistance in the setting of a tertiary referral center at a University hospital. Between February and November 2004 we enrolled 511 consecutive patients. Each patient was examined by two nonexpert physicians with low to moderate diagnostic skills who were allowed to use a neural network-based diagnostic system at their own discretion. Every patient was also examined by an expert dermatologist using standard dermatoscopy equipment. The nonexpert physicians used the automatic diagnostic system in 3827 pigmented skin lesions. In their hands, the system achieved a sensitivity of 72\% and a specificity of 82\%. The sensitivity was significantly lower than that of the expert physician (72 vs. 96\%, P = 0.001), whereas the specificity was significantly higher (82 vs. 72\%, P<0.01). Three melanomas were missed because the physicians who operated the system did not choose them for examination. The system as a stand-alone device had an average discriminatory power of 0.87, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, with optimal sensitivities and specificities of 75 and 84\%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy achieved in this clinical trial was lower than that achieved in a previous experimental trial of the same system. In total, the performance of a decision-support system for melanoma diagnosis under real-life conditions is lower than that expected from experimental data and depends upon the physicians who are using the system.},

	Abstract = {Since advanced melanoma remains practically incurable, early detection is an important step toward a reduction in mortality. High expectations are entertained for a technique known as dermoscopy or epiluminescence light microscopy; however, evaluation of pigmented skin lesions by this method is often extremely complex and subjective. To obviate the problem of qualitative interpretation, methods based on mathematical analysis of pigmented skin lesions, such as digital dermoscopy analysis, have been developed. In the present study, we used a digital dermoscopy analyzer (DBDermo-Mips system) to evaluate a series of 588 excised, clinically atypical, flat pigmented skin lesions (371 benign, 217 malignant). The analyzer evaluated 48 parameters grouped into 4 categories (geometries, colors, textures and islands of color), which were used to train an artificial neural network. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the neural network and to check it during the training process, we used the error area over the receiver operating characteristic curve. The discriminating power of the digital dermoscopy analyzer plus artificial neural network was compared with histologic diagnosis. A feature selection procedure indicated that as few as 13 of the variables were sufficient to discriminate the 2 groups of lesions, and this also ensured high generalization power. The artificial neural network designed with these variables enabled a diagnostic accuracy of about 94\%. In conclusion, the good diagnostic performance and high speed in reading and analyzing lesions (real time) of our method constitute an important step in the direction of automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions.},

	Abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

	Abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

	Abstract = {How the brain encodes information in population activity, and how it combines and manipulates that activity as it carries out computations, are questions that lie at the heart of systems neuroscience. During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

	Abstract = {Learning and memory has been studied extensively in Drosophila using behavioral, molecular, and genetic approaches. These studies have identified the mushroom body as essential for the formation and retrieval of olfactory memories. We investigated odor responses of the principal neurons of the mushroom body, the Kenyon cells (KCs), in Drosophila using whole cell recordings in vivo. KC responses to odors were highly selective and, thus sparse, compared with those of their direct inputs, the antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs). We examined the mechanisms that might underlie this transformation and identified at least three contributing factors: excitatory synaptic potentials (from PNs) decay rapidly, curtailing temporal integration, PN convergence onto individual KCs is low ( approximately 10 PNs per KC on average), and KC firing thresholds are high. Sparse activity is thought to be useful in structures involved in memory in part because sparseness tends to reduce representation overlaps. By comparing activity patterns evoked by the same odors across olfactory receptor neurons and across KCs, we show that representations of different odors do indeed become less correlated as they progress through the olfactory system.},

	Abstract = {We examined the encoding and decoding of odor identity and intensity by neurons in the antennal lobe and the mushroom body, first and second relays, respectively, of the locust olfactory system. Increased odor concentration led to changes in the firing patterns of individual antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), similar to those caused by changes in odor identity, thus potentially confounding representations for identity and concentration. However, when these time-varying responses were examined across many PNs, concentration-specific patterns clustered by identity, resolving the apparent confound. This is because PN ensemble representations changed relatively continuously over a range of concentrations of each odorant. The PNs' targets in the mushroom body-Kenyon cells (KCs)-had sparse identity-specific responses with diverse degrees of concentration invariance. The tuning of KCs to identity and concentration and the patterning of their responses are consistent with piecewise decoding of their PN inputs over oscillation-cycle length epochs.},

	Abstract = {The mushroom body is an insect brain structure required for olfactory learning. Its principal neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs), form a large cell population. The neuronal populations from which their olfactory input derives (olfactory sensory and projection neurons) can be identified individually by genetic, anatomical, and physiological criteria. We ask whether KCs are similarly identifiable individually, using genetic markers and whole-cell patch-clamp in vivo. We find that across-animal responses are as diverse within the genetically labeled subset as across all KCs in a larger sample. These results combined with those from a simple model, using projection neuron odor responses as inputs, suggest that the precise circuit specification seen at earlier stages of odor processing is likely absent among the mushroom body KCs.},

	Abstract = {Recent experiments involving shaded 2-D stimuli have shown that early-vision mechanisms are capable of interpreting 3-D shape from shading. In particular, target discrimination tasks suggest that a target 'pops out' when background distractors, but not the target, can be interpreted as convex and lit from above or top-left. Since the problem of extracting 3-D shape from shading is intrinsically ill-defined, early vision may need to make these twin assumptions of convexity and top-left lighting in order to constrain the problem. Would these assumptions be recognized as unnecessary and consequently discarded when 3-D shape could be unambiguously defined by some other cue, like stereo disparity? A 2AFC stimulus onset asynchrony paradigm with masking was used in target discrimination experiments. The performance of five naive subjects on tasks where only shading cues were present was compared with that on tasks involving shading as well as stereo cues that define shape unambiguously. The results show that although stereo disparity information is incorporated by early-vision 3-D mechanisms, it is not used to overturn the default assumptions of lighting and shape. Stereo information is interpreted within the framework of top-left lighting, and a consistent preference for convexity is seen over concavity.},

Unshaded line drawings of the same shapes, however, are processed serially. Strong pop-out asymmetries and control experiments involving shaded patterns that do not have familiar 3-D interpretations suggest that such fast, parallel processing is dependent upon perception 3-D shape. Furthermore, this process can be influenced by contextual scene information, in a manner that is dependent upon whether the additional cues contribute to the perception of a consistent 3-D scene.},

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers.},

	Abstract = {We present a camera-based method for automatically quantifying the individual and social behaviors of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, interacting in a planar arena. Our system includes machine-vision algorithms that accurately track many individuals without swapping identities and classification algorithms that detect behaviors. The data may be represented as an ethogram that plots the time course of behaviors exhibited by each fly or as a vector that concisely captures the statistical properties of all behaviors displayed in a given period. We found that behavioral differences between individuals were consistent over time and were sufficient to accurately predict gender and genotype. In addition, we found that the relative positions of flies during social interactions vary according to gender, genotype and social environment. We expect that our software, which permits high-throughput screening, will complement existing molecular methods available in Drosophila, facilitating new investigations into the genetic and cellular basis of behavior.},

	Abstract = {What can we see when we do not pay attention? It is well known that we can be "blind" even to major aspects of natural scenes when we attend elsewhere. The only tasks that do not need attention appear to be carried out in the early stages of the visual system. Contrary to this common belief, we report that subjects can rapidly detect animals or vehicles in briefly presented novel natural scenes while simultaneously performing another attentionally demanding task. By comparison, they are unable to discriminate large T's from L's, or bisected two-color disks from their mirror images under the same conditions. We conclude that some visual tasks associated with "high-level" cortical areas may proceed in the near absence of attention.},

	Abstract = {Studies have suggested attention-free semantic processing of natural scenes in which concurrent tasks leave category detection unimpaired (e.g., F. Li, R. VanRullen, C. Koch, \& P. Perona, 2002). Could this ability reflect detection of disjunctive feature sets rather than high-level binding? Participants detected an animal target in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequence and then reported its identity and location. They frequently failed to identify or to localize targets that they had correctly detected, suggesting that detection was based only on partial processing. Detection of targets was considerably worse in sequences that also contained humans, presumably because of shared features. When 2 targets were presented in RSVP, a prolonged attentional blink appeared that was almost eliminated when both targets were detected without being identified. The results suggest rapid feature analysis mediating detection, followed by attention-demanding binding for identification and localization.},

	Abstract = {What do we see when we glance at a natural scene and how does it change as the glance becomes longer? We asked naive subjects to report in a free-form format what they saw when looking at briefly presented real-life photographs. Our subjects received no specific information as to the content of each stimulus. Thus, our paradigm differs from previous studies where subjects were cued before a picture was presented and/or were probed with multiple-choice questions. In the first stage, 90 novel grayscale photographs were foveally shown to a group of 22 native-English-speaking subjects. The presentation time was chosen at random from a set of seven possible times (from 27 to 500 ms). A perceptual mask followed each photograph immediately. After each presentation, subjects reported what they had just seen as completely and truthfully as possible. In the second stage, another group of naive individuals was instructed to score each of the descriptions produced by the subjects in the first stage. Individual scores were assigned to more than a hundred different attributes. We show that within a single glance, much object- and scene-level information is perceived by human subjects. The richness of our perception, though, seems asymmetrical. Subjects tend to have a propensity toward perceiving natural scenes as being outdoor rather than indoor. The reporting of sensory- or feature-level information of a scene (such as shading and shape) consistently precedes the reporting of the semantic-level information. But once subjects recognize more semantic-level components of a scene, there is little evidence suggesting any bias toward either scene-level or object-level recognition.},

	Abstract = {Realistic portraits, whether paintings or photographs, are traditionally obtained using perspective projection. Pictures of the face taken from different distances along the same viewing direction (e.g. frontal) may be scaled to occupy the same size on the image plane. However, such portraits differ systematically: e.g. when the center of projection (the camera) is closer to the face the nose is proportionally larger in the picture. These differences are small (for typical camera distances of 50-500cm): do they have an effect on how the face is perceived?
Ten naive subjects of both sexes, viewed equally scaled frontal pictures of 15 neutral-expression adult male faces, each photographed from distances of 56, 124 and 400cm. The photographs were corrected for lens distortion to obtain ideal perspective projections. The subjects were asked to rate each portrait according to 13 attributes (evil-good, repulsive-attractive, hostile-friendly, pushy-respectful, sad-happy, dishonest-honest, introvert-extrovert, violent-peaceful, dumb-smart, distant-approachable, evasive-candid, week-strong, unpleasant-pleasant). While the subjects were unaware of the manipulation, their ratings are systematically correlated with the distance: faces imaged from the closer distance appear significantly more benevolent (good, peaceful, pleasant, approachable), those taken from a larger distance appear more impressive (smarter, stronger). Intermediate-distance portraits appeared more attractive. The remaining attributes are not significantly different across distance.
Our findings suggest that painters and photographers may manipulate the emotional content of a portrait by choosing an appropriate viewing distance: e.g. a formal and official portrait may benefit from a distant viewpoint, while an effect of intimacy and opennes may be obtained with a close viewpoint. Multiple inconsistent viewpoints found in classical full-length portraits may be explained by the need to combine close-up views of some body parts, within an overall undistorted figure.},

	Annote = {Virtual immersive environments or telepresence
                  setups often consist of multiple cameras which have
                  to be calibrated. We present a convenient method for
                  doing this. The minimum is three cameras, but there
                  is no upper limit. The method is fully automatic and
                  a freely moving bright spot is the only calibration
                  object. A set of virtual 3D points is made by waving
                  the bright spot through the working volume. Its
                  projections are found with sub-pixel precision and
                  verified by a robust RANSAC analysis. The cameras do
                  not have to see all points, only reasonable overlap
                  between camera subgroups is necessary. Projective
                  structures are computed via rank-4 factorization and
                  the Euclidean stratification is done by imposing
                  geometric constraints. This linear estimate
                  initializes a post-processing computation of
                  non-linear distortion which is also fully
                  automatic. We suggest a trick on how to use a very
                  ordinary laser pointer as the calibration object. We
                  show that it is possible to calibrate an immersive
                  virtual environment with 16 cameras in less than 30
                  minutes reaching about 1/5 pixel reprojection
                  error. The method has been successfully tested on
                  numerous multi-camera environments with a varying
                  number and quality of cameras used.},

	Abstract = {Several genetic strategies for inhibiting neuronal function in mice have been described, but no system that directly suppresses membrane excitability and is triggered by a systemically administered drug, has been validated in awake behaving animals. We expressed unilaterally in mouse striatum a modified heteromeric ivermectin (IVM)-gated chloride channel from C. elegans (GluClalphabeta), systemically administered IVM, and then assessed amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Rotation was observed as early as 4 hr after a single intraperitoneal IVM injection (10 mg/kg), reached maximal levels by 12 hr, and was almost fully reversed by 4 days. Multiple cycles of silencing and recovery could be performed in a single animal. In striatal slice preparations from GluClalphabeta-expressing animals, IVM rapidly suppressed spiking. The two-subunit GluCl/IVM system permits "intersectional" strategies designed to increase the cellular specificity of silencing in transgenic animals.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obtaining a complete phenotypic characterization of a freely moving organism is a difficult task, yet such a description is desired in many neuroethological studies. Many metrics currently used in the literature to describe locomotor and exploratory behavior are typically based on average quantities or subjectively chosen spatial and temporal thresholds. All of these measures are relatively coarse-grained in the time domain. It is advantageous, however, to employ metrics based on the entire trajectory that an organism takes while exploring its environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To characterize the locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, we used a video tracking system to record the trajectory of a single fly walking in a circular open field arena. The fly was tracked for two hours. Here, we present techniques with which to analyze the motion of the fly in this paradigm, and we discuss the methods of calculation. The measures we introduce are based on spatial and temporal probability distributions and utilize the entire time-series trajectory of the fly, thus emphasizing the dynamic nature of locomotor behavior. Marginal and joint probability distributions of speed, position, segment duration, path curvature, and reorientation angle are examined and related to the observed behavior. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The measures discussed in this paper provide a detailed profile of the behavior of a single fly and highlight the interaction of the fly with the environment. Such measures may serve as useful tools in any behavioral study in which the movement of a fly is an important variable and can be incorporated easily into many setups, facilitating high-throughput phenotypic characterization.},

	Abstract = {Male courtship behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster is modified by prior sexual experience. Whereas naive males nearly always court virgin females persistently, males previously paired with unreceptive fertilized females subsequently court virgin females in an abbreviated manner, if at all. The probability of diminished male courtship is directly related to the duration of the prior "conditioning" period with a fertilized female. Naive males court fertilized females less vigorously than they court virgins; this depression of male behavior occurs even if the male is blind or if the fertilized female cannot actively reject his courtship. These results suggest that fertilized females are a source of both courtship-provoking and courtship-inhibiting olfactory cues and that the central association of these cues in males is sufficient to bring about the retention of modified courtship behavior. Mutant "amnesiac" males, selected as memory-deficient in a learning test unrelated to courtship [Quinn, W. G., Sziber, P. P. & Booker, R. (1979) Nature (London) 277, 212-214], are trainable by exposure to fertilized females, but the experience-dependent behavior-diminished courtship performance-wanes abnormally rapidly-i.e., less than 1 hour, compared to 2-3 hr for wild-type flies.},

	Abstract = {Behavior analysis of social insects has garnered impetus in recent years and has led to some advances in fields like control systems, flight navigation etc. Manual labeling of insect motions required for analyzing the behaviors of insects requires significant investment of time and effort. In this paper, we propose certain general principles that help in simultaneous automatic tracking and behavior analysis with applications in tracking bees and recognizing specific behaviors exhibited by them. The state space for tracking is defined using position, orientation and the current behavior of the insect being tracked. The position and orientation are parametrized using a shape model while the behavior is explicitly modeled using a three-tier hierarchical motion model. The first tier (dynamics) models the local motions exhibited and the models built in this tier act as a vocabulary for behavior modeling. The second tier is a Markov motion model built on top of the local motion vocabulary which serves as the behavior model. The third tier of the hierarchy models the switching between behaviors and this is also modeled as a Markov model. We address issues in learning the three-tier behavioral model, in discriminating between models, detecting and in modeling abnormal behaviors. Another important aspect of this work is that it leads to joint tracking and behavior analysis instead of the traditional track and then recognize approach. We apply these principles for tracking bees in a hive while they are executing the waggle dance and the round dance.},

	Abstract = {We describe a particle filter that effectively deals with interacting targets--targets that are influenced by the proximity and/or behavior of other targets. The particle filter includes a Markov random field (MRF) motion prior that helps maintain the identity of targets throughout an interaction, significantly reducing tracker failures. We show that this MRF prior can be easily implemented by including an additional interaction factor in the importance weights of the particle filter. However, the computational requirements of the resulting multitarget filter render it unusable for large numbers of targets. Consequently, we replace the traditional importance sampling step in the particle filter with a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling step to obtain a more efficient MCMC-based multitarget filter. We also show how to extend this MCMC-based filter to address a variable number of interacting targets. Finally, we present both qualitative and quantitative experimental results, demonstrating that the resulting particle filters deal efficiently and effectively with complicated target interactions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how ethanol influences behavior is key to deciphering the mechanisms of ethanol action and alcoholism. In mammals, low doses of ethanol stimulate locomotion, whereas high doses depress it. The acute stimulant effect of ethanol has been proposed to be a manifestation of its rewarding effects. In Drosophila, ethanol exposure transiently potentiates locomotor activity in a biphasic dose- and time-dependent manner. An initial short-lived peak of activity corresponds to an olfactory response to ethanol. A second, longer-lasting period of increased activity coincides with rising internal ethanol concentrations; these closely parallel concentrations that stimulate locomotion in mammals. High-resolution analysis of the walking pattern of individual flies revealed that locomotion consists of bouts of activity; bout structure can be quantified by bout frequency, bout length, and the time spent walking at high speeds. Ethanol exposure induces both dramatic and dynamic changes in bout structure. Mutants with increased ethanol sensitivity show distinct changes in ethanol-induced locomotor behavior, as well as genotype-specific changes in activity bout structure. Thus, the overall effect of ethanol on locomotor behavior in Drosophila is caused by changes in discrete quantifiable parameters of walking pattern. The effects of ethanol on locomotion are comparable in flies and mammals, suggesting that Drosophila is a suitable model system to study the underlying mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caenorhabditis elegans locomotion is a simple behavior that has been widely used to dissect genetic components of behavior, synaptic transmission, and muscle function. Many of the paradigms that have been created to study C. elegans locomotion rely on qualitative experimenter observation. Here we report the implementation of an automated tracking system developed to quantify the locomotion of multiple individual worms in parallel. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our tracking system generates a consistent measurement of locomotion that allows direct comparison of results across experiments and experimenters and provides a standard method to share data between laboratories. The tracker utilizes a video camera attached to a zoom lens and a software package implemented in MATLAB. We demonstrate several proof-of-principle applications for the tracker including measuring speed in the absence and presence of food and in the presence of serotonin. We further use the tracker to automatically quantify the time course of paralysis of worms exposed to aldicarb and levamisole and show that tracker performance compares favorably to data generated using a hand-scored metric. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although this is not the first automated tracking system developed to measure C. elegans locomotion, our tracking software package is freely available and provides a simple interface that includes tools for rapid data collection and analysis. By contrast with other tools, it is not dependent on a specific set of hardware. We propose that the tracker may be used for a broad range of additional worm locomotion applications including genetic and chemical screening.},

	Abstract = {Sustained increases in life expectancy have underscored the importance of managing diseases with a high incidence in late life, such as various neurodegenerative conditions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common among these, and consequently significant research effort is spent on studying it. Although a lot is known about the pathology of AD and the role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, the complete network of interactions regulating Abeta metabolism and toxicity still eludes us. To address this, we have conducted genetic interaction screens using transgenic Drosophila expressing Abeta and we have identified mutations that affect Abeta metabolism and toxicity. These analyses highlight the involvement of various biochemical processes such as secretion, cholesterol homeostasis, and regulation of chromatin structure and function, among others, in mediating toxic Abeta effects. Several of the mutations that we identified have not been linked to Abeta toxicity before and thus constitute novel potential targets for AD intervention. We additionally tested these mutations for interactions with tau and expanded-polyglutamine overexpression and found a few candidate mutations that may mediate common mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Our data offer insight into the toxicity of Abeta and open new areas for further study into AD pathogenesis.},

How do distinct neural subcircuits, composed of different classes of neuron, contribute to brain function? Approaching this question requires methods that can target specific neurons types. This can be achieved by harnessing the same machinery that builds sophistication into the brain and using it to make novel tools for investigating and manipulating the brain: molecular and genetic technology. These tools can be used to target gene expression to specific neuron types within complicated neuronal circuits, and the transgenes that are expressed can be used to elucidate and manipulate these circuits with unprecedented precision and control.

	Abstract = {Research on aging in Drosophila continues to provide new insights into this complex process. Drosophila is highly amenable to study aging because of its short generation time, comprehensive resources for genetic manipulation, and functionally conserved physiology. Importantly, many of these physiological processes such as heart function, sleep, and metabolism functionally senescence in older flies. As the evolutionarily conserved insulin and TOR pathways are critical regulators of aging, the influence of insulin and TOR signaling on these processes is an important area for future research. An important emerging theme is determining the age-dependent alterations that occur at the organ level and how this functional senescence is regulated by different tissues.},

	Abstract = {In 2000, Drosophila melanogaster joined the ranks of vertebrates and invertebrates with a defined behavioral sleep state. The characterization of this sleep state revealed striking similarities to sleep in humans: sleep in flies has both circadian and homeostatic components, it is influenced by sex and age, and it is affected by pharmacological agents such as caffeine and antihistamines. As in mammals, arousal thresholds in flies increase with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, changes in brain electrical activity accompany the change from wake to sleep states. Not only do flies and vertebrates share these behavioral and physiological traits of sleep, but they are likely to share at least some genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep as well. This article reviews the methods currently used to identify and characterize the Drosophila sleep state. As these methods become more refined and our understanding of Drosophila sleep more detailed, the powerful techniques afforded by this organism are likely to unveil deep insights into the function(s) and regulatory mechanisms of sleep.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In mammals and humans, noradrenaline is a key modulator of aggression. Octopamine, a closely related biogenic amine, has been proposed to have a similar function in arthropods. However, the effect of octopamine on aggressive behavior is little understood. RESULTS: An automated video analysis of aggression in male Drosophila has been developed, rendering aggression accessible to high-throughput studies. The software detects the lunge, a conspicuous behavioral act unique to aggression. In lunging, the aggressor rears up on his hind legs and snaps down on his opponent. By using the software to eliminate confounding effects, we now show that aggression is almost abolished in mutant males lacking octopamine. This suppression is independent of whether tyramine, the precursor of octopamine, is increased or also depleted. Restoring octopamine synthesis in the brain either throughout life or in adulthood leads to a partial rescue of aggression. Finally, neuronal silencing of octopaminergic and tyraminergic neurons almost completely abolishes lunges. CONCLUSIONS: Octopamine modulates Drosophila aggression. Genetically depleting the animal of octopamine downregulates lunge frequency without a sizable effect on the lunge motor program. This study provides access to the neuronal circuitry mediating this modulation.},

	Abstract = {A great challenge facing neuroscience is to understand how genes, molecules, cells, circuits, and systems interact to generate social behavior. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) offer a powerful model system to address questions of this magnitude. These animals display genetically specified, sexually dimorphic patterns of fighting behavior via sex-specific splicing of the fruitless gene. Here, we show that sexually dimorphic behavioral patterns displayed during aggression are controlled by specific subgroups of neurons expressing male forms of fruitless proteins (Fru(M)). Using the GAL4/UAS system to manipulate transformer expression, we feminized or masculinized different populations of neurons in fly nervous systems. With a panneuronal elav-GAL4 driver, male patterns of fighting behavior were transferred into females and female patterns into males. We screened 60 Gal4 lines that express the yeast transcription factor in different patterns in fly central nervous systems and found five that showed abnormal same-sex courtship behavior. The sexually dimorphic fighting patterns, however, were completely switched only in one and partially switched in a second of these lines. In the other three lines, female patterns of aggression were seen despite a switch in courtship preference. A tight correspondence was seen between Fru(M) expression and how flies fight in several subgroups of neurons usually expressing these proteins: Expression is absent when flies fight like females and present when flies fight like males, thereby beginning a separation between courtship and aggression among these neurons.},

	Abstract = {In its natural environment, which consists of fermenting plant materials, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encounters high levels of ethanol. Flies are well equipped to deal with the toxic effects of ethanol; they use it as an energy source and for lipid biosynthesis. The primary ethanol-metabolizing pathway in flies involves the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH); their role in adaptation to ethanol-rich environments has been studied extensively. The similarity between Drosophila and mammals is not restricted to the manner in which they metabolize ethanol; behaviors elicited by ethanol exposure are also remarkably similar in these organisms. Flies show signs of acute intoxication, which range from locomotor stimulation at low doses to complete sedation at higher doses, they develop tolerance upon intermittent ethanol exposure, and they appear to like ethanol, showing preference for ethanol-containing media. Molecular genetic analysis of ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila, while still in its early stages, has already revealed some surprising parallels with mammals. The availability of powerful tools for genetic manipulation in Drosophila, together with the high degree of conservation at the genomic level, make Drosophila a promising model organism to study the mechanism by which ethanol regulates behavior and the mechanisms underlying the organism's adaptation to long-term ethanol exposure.},

	Abstract = {Susceptibility to drug addiction depends on genetic and environmental factors and their complex interactions. Studies with mammalian models have identified molecular targets, neurochemical systems, and brain regions that mediate some of the addictive properties of abused drugs. Yet, our understanding of how the primary effects of drugs lead to addiction remains incomplete. Recently, researchers have turned to the invertebrate model systems Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the mechanisms by which abused drugs modulate behavior. Due to their sophisticated genetics, relatively simple anatomy, and their remarkable molecular similarity to mammals, these invertebrate models should provide useful insights into the mechanisms of drug action. Here we review recent behavioral and genetic studies in flies and worms on the effects of ethanol, cocaine, and nicotine, three of the most widely abused drugs in the world.},

	Abstract = {Humans move their eyes while looking at scenes and pictures. Eye movements correlate with shifts in attention and are thought to be a consequence of optimal resource allocation for high-level tasks such as visual recognition. Models of attention, such as "saliency maps," are often built on the assumption that "early" features (color, contrast, orientation, motion, and so forth) drive attention directly. We explore an alternative hypothesis: Observers attend to "interesting" objects. To test this hypothesis, we measure the eye position of human observers while they inspect photographs of common natural scenes. Our observers perform different tasks: artistic evaluation, analysis of content, and search. Immediately after each presentation, our observers are asked to name objects they saw. Weighted with recall frequency, these objects predict fixations in individual images better than early saliency, irrespective of task. Also, saliency combined with object positions predicts which objects are frequently named. This suggests that early saliency has only an indirect effect on attention, acting through recognized objects. Consequently, rather than treating attention as mere preprocessing step for object recognition, models of both need to be integrated.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a method based on machine vision for automatically measuring aggression and courtship in Drosophila melanogaster. The genetic and neural circuit bases of these innate social behaviors are poorly understood. High-throughput behavioral screening in this genetically tractable model organism is a potentially powerful approach, but it is currently very laborious. Our system monitors interacting pairs of flies and computes their location, orientation and wing posture. These features are used for detecting behaviors exhibited during aggression and courtship. Among these, wing threat, lunging and tussling are specific to aggression; circling, wing extension (courtship 'song') and copulation are specific to courtship; locomotion and chasing are common to both. Ethograms may be constructed automatically from these measurements, saving considerable time and effort. This technology should enable large-scale screens for genes and neural circuits controlling courtship and aggression.},

	Abstract = {How do reward outcomes affect early visual performance? Previous studies found a suboptimal influence, but they ignored the non-linearity in how subjects perceived the reward outcomes. In contrast, we find that when the non-linearity is accounted for, humans behave optimally and maximize expected reward. Our subjects were asked to detect the presence of a familiar target object in a cluttered scene. They were rewarded according to their performance. We systematically varied the target frequency and the reward/penalty policy for detecting/missing the targets. We find that 1) decreasing the target frequency will decrease the detection rates, in accordance with the literature. 2) Contrary to previous studies, increasing the target detection rewards will compensate for target rarity and restore detection performance. 3) A quantitative model based on reward maximization accurately predicts human detection behavior in all target frequency and reward conditions; thus, reward schemes can be designed to obtain desired detection rates for rare targets. 4) Subjects quickly learn the optimal decision strategy; we propose a neurally plausible model that exhibits the same properties. Potential applications include designing reward schemes to improve detection of life-critical, rare targets (e.g., cancers in medical images).},

@article{KT08,
    abstract = {{10.1073/pnas.0802631105 Algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g.,  ” bigger than” or  ” better than”) respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.}},
