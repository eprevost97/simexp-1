\section{Relative regression}

In this section, we consider the following natural relative regression model.  There is a probability distribution $\rho$ over $(x,y,z) \in X \times \{0,1\} \times X$ and some unknown $w^* \in W$, where $X,W \subset \reals^d$ are known compact convex sets such that $x \cdot w \in [\alpha,\beta]$ for some $\alpha>0$, for all $x\in X, w \in W$.  It is assumed that,
$$
\Pr[y=1|x,z] = \frac{w^* \cdot x}{w^* \cdot x + w^* \cdot z}=p(w^*,x,z),$$
where $p(w,x,z)$ is defined to be $w\cdot x/(w \cdot x+w\cdot z)$.  Note that $p(w,x,z)+p(w,z,x)=1$.  The goal is, given i.i.d. samples, $(x_1,y_1,z_1),\ldots,(x_m,y_m,z_m)$ from $\rho$, to learn $w^*$, or more formally to make predictions almost as accurate as if we knew $w^*$ (since in some cases there may be several such $w^*$).  Here we analyze log-loss but we mention that similar theorems can be proven for a regression setting with squared loss, where  $y \in [0,1]$.
The log-loss of a solution $w$ is,
\begin{align*}
\cL(w) &= \E\left[ y \log 1/p(w,x,z) + (1-y)  \log 1/p(w,z,x)\right] \\
&=
\E\left[ p(w^*,x,z) \log 1/p(w^*,x,z) + p(w^*,z,x) \log 1/p(w,z,x)\right].
\end{align*}

By Lemma \ref{lem:appx1} (stated later), we have,
$$\cL(w) -\cL(w^*) \leq \E\left[\frac{(p(w,x,z)-p(w^*,x,z))^2}{p(w,x,z)p(w,z,x)}\right].$$


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:appx1}
Let $p+q=1$ and $p^*+q^*=1$ for $p,p^* \in [0,1]$.  Then,
$$p^* \log \frac{p^*}{p} + q^* \log \frac{q^*}{q} \leq \frac{(p-p^*)^2}{pq}.$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By concavity of $\log$, Jensen's inequality implies,
$$p^* \log \frac{p^*}{p} + q^* \log \frac{q^*}{q}  \leq \log \frac{(p^*)^2}{p} + \frac{(q^*)^2}{q}.$$
Simple algebraic manipulation shows that,
$$\frac{(p^*)^2}{p} + \frac{(q^*)^2}{q} = 1 + \frac{(p-p^*)^2}{pq}.$$
Finally, the fact that $\log 1+x \leq x$ completes the lemma.
\end{proof}
